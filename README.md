# OldKettler2Zwift

!!!Work in Progress!!!

This software upgrades your classic Kettler indoor bike into an intelligent training device, enabling connectivity with your preferred fitness applications. Designed to operate on a Raspberry Pi, the program establishes a serial port connection with your Kettler bike, managing data processing and transmission to platforms like Zwift or similar services. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi actively monitors incoming requests from Zwift, adjusting the bike's resistance to match the virtual training environment.
